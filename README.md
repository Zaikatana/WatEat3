# WatEat

This project was developed with a TypeScript and ReactJS stack. It utilises the Yelp Fusion & Google Maps APIs to search for open restaurants in a user defined radius.

## Purpose
This web application was built with the purpose of allowing users to search for places to eat. The places appear as cards and users can choose to pass on places to view the next available option.

While this project is still very much a work in progress (UI could be better, Mobile support, CORS bypassing, performing a request to retrieve categories, etc.), it has pretty much reached a Minimal Viable Product (MVP) status.

This web application is built as a fun and non-profitable project to add to Brian Luc's (the Author) portfolio.

## Features
- Search for Open restaurants in a user defined radius
- View location of restaurant in a map
- Browse through a list of restaurants

## Third-Party Libraries used
- [react-google-maps/api] - React Component to streamline the use of the google maps api (https://github.com/JustFly1984/react-google-maps-api)
